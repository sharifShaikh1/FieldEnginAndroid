OR  An effect function must not return anything besides a function, which is used for clean-up.

It looks like you wrote 'useFocusEffect(async () => ...)' or returned a Promise. Instead, write the async function inside your effect and call it immediately:

useFocusEffect(
  React.useCallback(() => {
    async function fetchData() {
      // You can await here
      const response = await MyAPI.getData(someId);
      // ...
    }

    fetchData();
  }, [someId])
);
